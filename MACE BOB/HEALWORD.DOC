Heal the World

There's a place in your heart, and I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try, you'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there, if you care enough for the living
Make a little space, make a better place

Chorus:
   Heal the world, make it a better place
   For you and for me and the entire human race
   There are people dying, if you care enough for the living
   Make a better place, for you and for me

If you want to know why, there's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see, in this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always love's enough for us growing
So make a better world, make a better world

Chorus

And the dream we were conceived in,  will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in, will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life, wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly, be God's glow

We could fly so high, let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear, together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there, if you cared enough for the living
Make a little space, to make a better place

Chorus (again  - up 1 note)

There are people dying, if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me.
There are people dying, if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
You and for me, you and for me, you and for me.......continue to end.
